# Terminology

## Wallet
- Has a user re-nameable friendly name
- Includes one main address by default
- Password protected, can be backed up and restored by users from backup
- Has a distinct encrypted data file in local app store
- User can add additional addresses
- Each user has one wallet by default when setting up the app but advanced users may create additional wallets
- Managed by the Spacemesh App but advanced users may use a CLI wallet that should support same data file and security features

## Address
- A public user identifier
- Used for all transactions
- Has a default re-nameable friendly display name
- Has an immutable public EC key and user has a matching private EC key for his public addresses
- Always part of a specific wallet. Has a unique shareable QR code.

## Full Node
- A spacemesh full p2p node running the Spacemesh blockmesh protocol. Working title for lack of a better agreed name by the team.
- Coinbase Address
- The user configured address for receiving validations awards in a full node
Validator
- The main full node role. Validators are responsible for both creating blocks and agreeing on blocks. Validators are spacemesh miners
- Dashboard
- The app section where users manage a locally running full node

## Spacemesh Coin
- Working title until we defined the final coin name for the testnet timeframe
