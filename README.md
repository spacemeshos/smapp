## Installation & Quick Start

Download the latest Smapp release from [Spacemesh Website](https://spacemesh.io/start/).

### Building from Source

Smapp is written in TypeScript and bundled within Electron. You need Node.js (v12) and Yarn to build from source. Make sure they are available on your system.

1. Clone the repository
2. Read `node/use-version` file: this is the version of `go-spacemesh` that should be used
3. Download the specified version from [Go-spacemesh Releases](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/releases)
4. Put the binary in either `node/windows`, `node/mac`, or `node/linux` folder, depending on you platform
5. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
6. Run `yarn start` to start the application in development mode

To build and pack application:

1. Run `yarn build`
2. Run one of the commands depending on your platform:
   - `yarn package-win`
   - `yarn package-mac`
     set env variable `DONT_SIGN_APP=1` to skip notarizing the app,
   - `yarn package-linux`

To run the application against DevNet you have to set URL to config file to env variable `DEV_NET_URL`:
```
DEV_NET_URL=https://.../config.json yarn start
```

To run the application against DevNet in the Wallet Only mode you have to also set URL (or list of URLs separated by commas) to GRPC API provider to env variable `DEV_NET_REMOTE_API`:
```
DEV_NET_REMOTE_API=https://192.168.0.1:31030 DEV_NET_URL=https://.../config.json yarn start
DEV_NET_REMOTE_API=https://192.168.0.1:31030,http://192.168.0.2:31035 DEV_NET_URL=https://.../config.json yarn start
```

To run Smapp on dev with turned on Sentry specify required env variables:
```
SENTRY_DSN='collection errors/logs url taken from sentry'
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN='special auth token for sentry cli integration'
SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=boolean # enables debug information
```

### Building Artifacts in CI

Smapp uses two workflows. Both of them builds an application for all supported platforms: windows, macOS, linux.

- **PR builds**
  Triggered by open Pull Request and any further changes on the branch.
  For testing and development purposes only.
  Unsigned and can not be trusted.
  Artifacts and links a temporary.
  Links to artifacts posted by the bot in comments.
- **Release builds**
  Triggered by tag `v*`.
  Public releases of Smapp.
  Signed for macOS and Windows platforms.
  Artifacts and links should be permanent.
  CI prepares a draft release with links to the artifacts.
