### Rationale

What do we have now, what do we want then?
How the implementation would make the product better for end-users?

### Prerequisites

Refer to issues by their #numbers that should be completed before the development of this issue would make sense

### User story

Describe the most straightforward usage scenario

- [ ] I open this
- [ ] I create that
- [ ] I click there
- [ ] I benefit from the result in a such way

### Acceptance criteria

Provide some steps that an end-user would be able to perform when the feature could be considered as implemented. E.g.:

- [ ] The basic scenario works as described
- [ ] If I do not enter a value, an error¹ is shown
- [ ] Clicking OK changes all nodes’ labels to the Foo value

### Out of scope
